# POO (Object-Oriented Programming)

## ✍️ Description

### Brief explanation

-   A set of 4 exercises (Banques, Cinema, Colmar (Entreprises), Livres) designed to introduce the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP).
-   Each exercise becomes progressively more complex, introducing new features and concepts of OOP.

### Learning objectives

-   Learn the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in PHP.
-   Understand and apply OOP concepts like classes, objects, methods, and inheritance.

## 📜 Guidelines

-   Complete each exercise by implementing OOP principles in PHP.
-   Respect the specific requirements and gradually increase the complexity of your solutions.

## 💪 Own Challenge

-   Applied strict coding standards, especially in specifying types for getters and setters, to ensure clean and maintainable code.

## 🚀 Features

-   Focus on the core principles of object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, etc.).
-   Exercises increase in complexity, introducing more advanced OOP features.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   PHP, HTML

## 🤔 Challenges Encountered

-   Adapting to a new coding paradigm with object-oriented programming and understanding the related syntax and best practices.

## 🔮 Possible Improvements
